## Mini Project 10
Instructions
Write a program that gets an integer i from the user and creates the table shown below on the screen (example inputs provided). Subroutines are required for power, square, and hexadecimal (in 32 bit arithmetic, attend to overflowed results). Hint: Hexadecimal can be done with shifts and masks because the size is 32 bits.

|i  | power(2,i) | square(i) | Hexadecimal(i)|
|---|--------- | ------------| --------------|
|10 | 1024     |   100       |  0xA          |
|7  | 128      |   49        |  0x7          |  
|16 | 65536    |   256       |  0x10         |
